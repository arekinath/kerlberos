Implementation of a basic KerberosV (KRB5) client for Erlang.

## What works

 * Get a TGT from an MIT krb5 server
 * Get a TGT from a Windows NT domain controller

Basically it's enough for validating user logins. Also can be built into a self-contained escript useable with the BSD Auth Framework.
